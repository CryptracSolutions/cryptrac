        <p>
          Cryptrac does not handle refunds. Any refund or dispute is strictly
          between you and your customer. Because payments are made directly
          to your wallet, chargebacks are not possible.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Best Practice Recommendations</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>For lowest cost and most transparency:</strong> receive the
            same crypto your customer sends by keeping Auto-Convert off.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For price stability and simplified accounting:</strong> turn
            Auto-Convert on to receive payments in your preferred stable coin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment amount strategy:</strong> set a minimum payment
            amount so network fees are a small percentage of each payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Review process:</strong> review payout details after each
            payment for a full breakdown of all fees.

          What fees will I pay, and which payout option is right for me?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want the lowest fees and are comfortable managing crypto,
          choose Auto-Convert off. If you prefer to avoid price swings and want
          all payments in one asset, enable Auto-Convertâ€”just remember the higher
          fees are due to conversion spread, not Cryptrac revenue.
